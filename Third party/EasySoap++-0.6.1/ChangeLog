	location.

0.5
	I forgot.  Too long ago.

0.4, aka WROX

0.1.4, aka Foot and Mouth 23-Mar-2001
	No real new features.  Added some stuff for configuring on
	a per compiler basis.  I don't like it.  I really need to
	do autoconf.  Now compiles on Cygwin32, MS VC++, Linux, FreeBSD

0.1.3, aka Roadkill 5-Feb-2001

	class and SOAPonHTTP class.  It should be trivial (easier) to
	implement your own transport and add new ones.

	experiment.  I didn't like it.
	Improved the HTTPProtocol to be more robust with dropped
	connections.
