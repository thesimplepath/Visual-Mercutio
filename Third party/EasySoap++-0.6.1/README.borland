Building EasySoap with Borland project files or makefiles.

1. Preliminaries

Borland project and makefiles are included to build EasySoap version 0.6 
using Borland C++ Builder version 5.0 Update Pack 1 or the C++ compiler 5.5.
You can probably use BCB6 too.

I have done limited tests with the makefiles with the free stand-alone 
comiler you can download from Borland. It seems to work ok.

win9x DOS commands are used in the main makefile makefile.mak and in 
setup.bat (which is used also by the projects). Adapting them to NT 
shouldn't be hard but you'll have to do that yourself at this stage. The 
easy way to do it is to delete the DOS commands in those files and do what
they do manually, its not hard.

You require Expat version 1.95.2 to be installed in a directory adjacent 
to EasySoap. The project and makefiles depend on the export lib 
expatrel.lib being in Expat-1.95.2/Libs, and setup.bat (invoked by both 
the projects and make files) tries to copy expatrel.dll from the Expat 
tree over to win32/release.

Since Expat doent presently come with Borland project files, 
you can get the Easysoap patch from version 0.5 which contains the Expat
projects. Its located on the EasySoap page on Sourceforge. A Borland 
patch will also (soon) be on the Expat page on Sourceforge.

The default build is a debug configuration even though the output directory
is called release.

2. Building

2.1 Using Makefiles

At a dos prompt, cd to easysoap\proj\win32\BCB5 and type make. 
If  everything  works, you have a bunch of .dll's, export libs, and 
exe's in  C:\EasySoap++-0.6\win32\release.

You can do a make clean to remove all the obj files, or a make cleanall 
to remove the win32 directories and everything in them.

2.2 Using Project Files
Just open easysoap.bpg in the BCB5 project directory and do 
a Build All.

3. Running EasySoap.

You should now be able to use EasySoap. You can immediately 
run 2 of the test programs: interopclient.exe and simpletest.exe. Both of these 
communicate with a soap server at sourceforge so you need your internet hookup 
open.4. FeedbackPost feedback to the EasySoap discussion Forum on sourceforge or
