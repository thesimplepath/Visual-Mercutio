/* TUNING ISSUES:
 * On machines that don't have a real memalign, WASTED_SPACE_IN_LEADER will be
 * true.  So chosing a page size is a trade off between wasting up to a page
 * per chunk to achive alignment, and using up memory for a large page map.
 * Note that a page is the smallest ammount that the gc will request from the
 * OS, so it should be reasonable (eg. not 1M on a 4M machine!)
 *
 * AlignmentWaste(worst) = PAGE_ALIGNMENT / MIN_XXX_PAGES * 
 *                         memory used / PAGE_ALIGNMENT;
 *                       = memory used / MIN_XXX_PAGES;
 * AlignmentWaste(avg)   = memory used / (2 * MIN_XXX_PAGES);
 *
 * PageMapSize(worst) = address space / PAGE_ALIGNMENT * 8
 *
 * MITIGATING FACTORS:
 *   A) The allocator tries to store the mark bits for a chunk in the aligment
 *      waste area.  Note that we need two mark bits for every two words, so:
 *          MarkBitsSize = memory used / 32;
 *      There are various round-off issues, but accounting for the savings of 
 *      storing the marks in the waste:
 * AlignmentWaste(mitigated_avg) = memory used / (2 * MIN_XXX_PAGES) - 
 *                                 memory used / 32;
 *      So, if you keep	MIN_XXX_PAGES > 16, AlignmentWaste approaches zero.
 *
 *   B) The page map is only large enough to span the pages handed to us by the
 *      OS, and it's unlikly that the OS will give us some pages at 0x00000000,
 *      then a few more pages near 0xFFFFFFFF.
 *
 * So, keep MIN_XXX_PAGES > 16, maximize PAGE_ALIGNMENT (especially if address 
 * space is large), but try to keep PAGE_ALIGNMENT * MIN_XXX_PAGES to a
 * size that the OS will usually be able to allocate.
