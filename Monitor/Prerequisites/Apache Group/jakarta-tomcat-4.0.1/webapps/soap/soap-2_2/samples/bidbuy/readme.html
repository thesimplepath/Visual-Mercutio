<H2 align="center">BidBuy Interoperability Sample</H2>
<P align="center">Apache SOAP specific code authored by: Matthew
J. Duftler &lt;<A href="mailto:duftler@us.ibm.com">duftler@us.ibm.com</A>&gt;</P>
<P>This directory contains code which implements
a scenario developed for the SOAP interoperability
face-to-face summarized <A href="http://www.apache.org/~dug/interop_f2f_04_19_01.html">here</A>. This README only describes how to run the
sample, and doesn't attempt to repeat any
of the information contained within that
summary or in its associated links. You can
also look at sample <A href="registry.wsdl">Registry</A> and <A href="bidbuy.wsdl">BidBuy</A> service WSDL files.<BR>
<I>
Note: This sample was completed long after
the interop session had occurred, and efforts
have been made to increase compatibility
significantly.</I></P>
<H3>Acknowledgements</H3>
<P>Thanks go out to Doug Davis and the rest
of the Axis development team for use of their
BidBuy Client GUI as well as for detailed
help on developing the sample.</P>
<H3>Client-Side</H3>
<P>The client portion of this scenario utilizes
a GUI created by the developers who are working
on the <A href="http://xml.apache.org/axis">Axis</A> project. The GUI, whose fully-qualified
class name is samples.bidbuy.client.rfq,
delegates all of its actions to an implementation
of a samples.bidbuy.client.vInterface. For
Apache SOAP, this interface is implemented
in the samples.bidbuy.client.ApacheSoapV2
class.</P>
<P>To run the client, make sure that you classpath
contains soap.jar and the directory which
contains the samples directory, then enter:</P>
<PRE>java samples.bidbuy.client.rfq</PRE>
<P>Note: There is a file called reg.lst, located
in the samples/bidbuy/client/registry directory,
which contains information about all known
registries of BidBuy services. The client
will look in the start-up directory for this
file, and if it can't find it, you will have
to manually add the registries via the GUI.</P>
<H3>Server-Side</H3>
<P>The server portion of this scenario consists
of 2 services: one that implements the RequestForQuote
services, and another that implements the
Buy and SimpleBuy services.</P>
<P>To deploy the first service, change to the
samples/bidbuy/server/registry directory
and enter:</P>
<PRE>java.org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient http://<B><I>soap-server</I></B>:<B><I>soap-port</I></B>/soap/servlet/rpcrouter deploy DeploymentDescriptor.xml</PRE>
<P>where <B><I>soap-server</I></B> and <B><I>soap-port</I></B> are the hostname and port of the machine
where the rpcrouter servlet is deployed.
Alternatively, you could run deploy.bat from
that directory, but it assumes localhost:8080.</P>
<P>To deploy the second service, change to the
samples/bidbuy/server/bid directory and enter:</P>
<PRE>java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient http://<B><I>soap-server</I></B>:<B><I>soap-port</I></B>/soap/servlet/rpcrouter deploy DeploymentDescriptor.xml</PRE>
<P>where <B><I>soap-server</I></B> and <B><I>soap-port</I></B> are the hostname and port of the machine
where the rpcrouter servlet is deployed.
Again, you could alternatively run deploy.bat
from that directory, but it assumes localhost:8080.</P>
<H3>Trying it Out</H3>
<P>You can use the client and the server to
talk to one another on the same machine,
you can use the client to talk to other servers,
or you can have other clients talk to your
server. (There is nothing that binds the
client and the server together, the are just
bundled that way for convenience.)<BR>
<I>
Note: The servers listed in reg.lst are scattered
all over the Internet, so you will need external
access to be able to use them.</I></P>
<P>To try out the sample, start up the client
as indicated above and select a Registration
Server from the list at the top of the GUI,
or enter a new one. (Even if there is a name
in the box at the top, you will need to pick
one from the list.) The client will then
talk to the selected registry and after a
couple of seconds will retrieve the list
of registered BidBuy services. Place a checkmark
next to one or more of the services that
you wish to talk to, and click on the <I>Request RFQs</I> button. Assuming that everything is working
correctly, you should get numbers appearing
in the Quote column of the services which
you selected after a second or two. You can
then select one of the services that you
received a quote from and issue a <I>Simple Buy</I> or <I>PO Buy</I> request to it using the bottom portion of
the interface.</P>
<P>If you want to add or remove BidBuy services
from the list on your client, you can use
the <I>Add Bid Server</I> and <I>Remove Server</I> buttons, respectively.</P>
<P><B>WARNING: The <I>Register Server</I> and <I>Unregister Server</I> buttons will modify the actual registries,
so unless you are putting up a server for
other people to test against, or unless you
are acting against your own registry, DO
NOT USE THEM!</B></P>
