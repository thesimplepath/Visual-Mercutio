Service:
-------
To install this service on an Apache-SOAP listener, you need to make
the samples.addressbook package available on the Apache-SOAP listener's
classpath. Then deploy this service by filling in the deployment
template using the info in the deployment descriptor in this
directory or by using the service manager client:
  java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient routerURL deploy dd.xml
where routerURL is the URL of the SOAP RPC router and dd.xml is the
name of the deployment descriptor file.  For example:
  java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient  \
    http://localhost:8080/soap/servlet/rpcrouter deploy DeploymentDescriptor.xml


Client:
------
  java samples.messaging.SendMessage router filename

where filename is one of msg*.xml.

msg1.xml: contains a valid message
msg2.xml: contains a valid message to a handler that throws an exception
msg3.xml: contains a valid message to the bogus handler that was listed
	  in the deployment file, but doesn't exist.
