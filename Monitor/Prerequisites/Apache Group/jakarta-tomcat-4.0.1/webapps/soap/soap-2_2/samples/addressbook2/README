This example illustrates how to use the support for maintaining
HTTP sessions across a series of calls. To get session support,
you need to create a SOAPHTTPConnection object, turn on the
"maintainSession" property and then tell the Call object to
use that object as the transport. The code is basically:

	Call call = new Call ();
	SOAPHTTPConnection shc = new SOAPHTTPConnection ();
	shc.setMaintainSession (true);
	call.setSOAPTransport (shc);

Once the above is done, you can use the "call" object to
make multiple calls and if the server you're talking to wishes
to maintain an HTTP session, then it will be maintained.

The AddressBookProxy class shows an example of using this using
the standard address book service (see ../addressbook) redeployed
with scope=session. So first deploy the service using the deployment
descriptor found in this directory and then run the class
samples.addressbook2.Main:
	Usage: java samples.addressbook2.Main [Service-URL]
