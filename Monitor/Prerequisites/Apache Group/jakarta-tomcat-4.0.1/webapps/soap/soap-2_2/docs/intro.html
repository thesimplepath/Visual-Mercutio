<p>Thank you for downloading Apache SOAP!</p>

<p>Apache SOAP is an open-source implementation of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP">SOAP v1.1</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments">SOAP Messages with
Attachments</a> specifications in Java. Apache SOAP is developed
by the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/soap">Apache SOAP</a>
community.</p>

<p>Apache SOAP can be used as a client library to invoke SOAP
services available elsewhere or as a server-side tool to
implement SOAP accessible services. As a client library it
provides an <a href="guide/rpcclient.html">API for invoking SOAP
RPC services</a> as well as an <a href="guide/msgclient.html">API
for sending and receiving SOAP messages</a>. As a mechanism to
write new <a href="guide/rpc.html">RPC accessible services</a> or
<a href="guide/message.html">message accessible services</a>, it
expects to be hosted by a servlet container (such as <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org" target="_top">Apache Tomcat</a>,
for example). While the codebase can be extended to support non-HTTP
transports, the provided code only has limited support for non-HTTP
transports (specifically, only for SMTP).</p>

<p>If you are new to SOAP and would like to learn more about SOAP
and Web services in general, there are many wonderful resources
available on the Web. Given below is a woefully incomplete list (in
no particular order) of great starting places:</p>

<h3>Requirements &amp; Limitations</h3>

<p>Apache SOAP has the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Java 1.1 or higher, and a servlet engine supporting
        version 2.1 or higher of the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Java Servlet
        API</a></li>
    <li>A JAXP compatible, namespace aware XML parser</li>
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">JavaMail</a>
        (mail.jar) and the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/beans/glasgow/jaf.html">JavaBeans
        Activation Framework</a> (activation.jar)</li>
    <li>XMI encoding requires use of Java 1.2.2 and <a
        href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML4J 2.0.15</a>.
        Your classpath must have xerces.jar first and then xml4j.jar
        next <strong>in that order</strong>.</li>
    <li>Implementing services in scripting languages requires the
        use of <a
        href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf/">Bean
        Scripting Framework</a>. </li>
    <li>SSL (HTTPS) support requires Java 1.2.1 or later and the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">Java Secure
        Socket Extension</a>.</li>
    <li>The SMTP transport requires the <a
        href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/smtp/">SMTP</a>
        and <a
        href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/pop3/">POP3</a>
        Bean Suites.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following features of the SOAP v1.1 specification are <strong>not</strong>
currently supported:</p>

<ul>
    <li>encodingStyle attribute must have only one encoding style
        given (see section 4.1.1 of the spec)</li>
    <li>mustUnderstand attribute support - only supports checking
        for and rejecting requests that require mustUnderstand
        checking</li>
    <li>root attribute</li>
    <li>actor attribute and SOAP intermediaries</li>
    <li>does not use multi-ref accessors during serialization</li>
</ul>

<p>The following limitations on SOAP Messages with Attachments
currently exist:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The document base URI is not picked up from the
        multipart's Content-Location header.</li>
    <li>Support for relative URIs in Content-Location headers is
        limited to concatenating the document base URI to the
        relative URI.</li>
    <li>The provided SMTP transport does not support multipart
        messages.</li>
    <li>Server-side RPC methods have no way to add attachments to
        the response other than via the return object. Messaging
        methods can do this already. </li>
</ul>
