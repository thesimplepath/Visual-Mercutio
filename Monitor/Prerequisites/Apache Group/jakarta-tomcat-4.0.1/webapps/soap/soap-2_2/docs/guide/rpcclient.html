<h2 align="center">Writing RPC Clients</h2>

<p>Writing clients to access SOAP RPC-based services is fairly
straightforward. Apache SOAP provides a client-side API to assist
in the construction of the SOAP request, and then to assist in
interpreting the response. Conceptually, RPC-based service are
relatively easy to understand, because the concepts involved are
those which may be found in any procedural based language. To
invoke a procedure, you need the name of the procedure and the
parameters to pass to it. When the invocation completes, you need
to extract any response information from the return value and/or
output parameters.</p>

<p>The basic steps for creating a client which interacts with a
SOAP RPC-based service are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Obtain the interface description of the SOAP service,
        so that you know what the signatures of the methods that
        you wish to invoke are.</b><br>
        You can either look at a WSDL file (or at some other
        interface definition format) for the service, or directly
        at its implementation.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Make sure that there are serializers registered for
        all parameters which you will be sending, and
        deserializers for all information which you will be
        receiving back.</b><br>
        Parameters must be serialized into/deserialized from XML
        before they can be transmitted/received, and so Apache
        SOAP provides a number of pre-defined serializers/deserializers
        which are available. If you need to transmit or receive a
        type which has not been registered, then you will need to
        <a href="serializer.html">write and register your own
        serializer/deserializer</a>.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Create the org.apache.soap.rpc.RPCMessage.Call object.</b><br>
        The Apache SOAP Call object is the main interface to the
        underlying SOAP RPC code<br>
        .<br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Set the target URI into the Call object using the
        setTargetObjectURI(...) method.</b><br>
        Pass in the URN that the service used to identify itself
        in its <a href="deploy.html">deployment descriptor</a>.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Set the method name that you wish to invoke into the
        Call object using the setMethodName(...) method.</b><br>
        This must be one of the methods exposed by the service
        which is identified by the URN given in the previous step.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Create any Parameter objects necessary for the RPC
        call and set them into the Call object using the
        setParams(...) method.</b><br>
        Make sure that you have the same number of parameters
        with the same types as the service is expecting. Also
        make sure that there are registered serializers/deserializers
        for the objects which you will be transmitting/receiving.
        (See step 2.)<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Execute the Call object's invoke(...) method and
        capture the Response object which is returned from invoke(...).</b><br>
        The invoke(...) method takes in two parameters, the first
        is a URL which identifies the endpoint at which the
        service resides (i.e. http://localhost/soap/servlet/rpcrouter)
        and the second is the value to be placed into the
        SOAPAction header. Remember that the RPC call is
        synchronous, and so may take a while to complete.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>Check the Response object to see if a fault was
        generated using the generatedFault() method.</b><br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>If a fault was returned, retrieve it using the
        getFault(...) method, otherwise extract any result or
        returned parameters using the getReturnValue() and
        getParams() methods respectively.</b><br>
        While most of the providers will only return a result, if
        you have created your own provider (or obtained one from
        somewhere else,) it may also return output parameters.<br>
        </li>
</ol>

<p>Because SOAP is a supposed to be a standard, you should be
able to use the clients that you create with the Apache SOAP API
to access services running on a different implementations, and
vice versa.<a name="RPC over SMTP"></a></p>

<h3>Special Note: Interacting with Stateful Services</h3>

<p>Services may be stateful - that is, once an interaction is
started with a service, a series of calls to it may interdepend
on each other. Apache SOAP supports authoring stateful services (via
<a href="deploy.html">deploying with a lifecycle of session</a>)
as well as calling stateful services. The currently, session
support is only available for HTTP.</p>

<p>HTTP session maintenance is on by default. What that means is
that if a service you are talking to via HTTP sets the
appropriate HTTP cookies to maintain the session, those will be
copied and stored in the call object used to invoke the service.
If another call is made using the same call object, then that
cookie will be sent back to the server, thus maintaining the
session. Thus, all you have to do is ensure that a single
instance of a call object is used across all the calls that you
wish to make over the same HTTP session.</p>

<p>The &quot;addressbook2&quot; sample shows an example of this
in action.</p>

<h3>Special Note: Using RPC over SMTP</h3>

<p>To do RPC over SMTP in Apache-SOAP a certain amount of email
infrastructure needs to be available. Namely, you need an SMTP
server, a POP3 server and an email address that you can use to be
the equivalent of the server-side HTTP router. That is, all SOAP
RPC calls are sent to a specific address which then processes the
request somehow and send the result to the sender. To avoid
duplicating the server-side infrastructure, we have implemented
the SMTP server-side as a bridge that receives mail sent to the
SOAP router email address via POP3, posts the SOAP envelope to an
existing HTTP SOAP infrastructure and sends the response back to
the sender of the email request via SMTP.</p>

<p>On the client side, the application sends the SOAP request via
SMTP to the SOAP router email address indicating the address that
the response should be sent to. Then, it starts polling a POP3
server to see whether the response has arrived. When it does, the
envelope is parsed and the response is extracted. We are using a <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/frame?ReadForm&amp;/ab.nsf/techmain/AD8820E9114E5B4488256723000AC87A">POP3
bean from alphaWorks</a> for the POP3 stuff and that bean does
not support selective downloading of email. As a result, the
current implementation relies on the &quot;next message&quot;
arriving to the client's reply address to be the message
containing the response to the request. The implication is that
current implementation does not allow you to make multiple RPC
calls using the same reply address at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: We <em>strongly</em> recommend against
using your own email address for testing RPC over SMTP. There are
many free POP3 email providers on the Web (such as <a
href="http://www.mailandnews.com">www.mailandnews.com</a>, for
example) if you are unable to set up multiple POP3 accounts
yourself.</p>
