<h2 align="center">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you came here then something has gone wrong. Let's see
whether we can help you find what's causing the problem and fix
it. Yes, the stuff does work and yes the samples do work .. at
least for us :-). Now let's try to make them work for you.</p>

<p>The table below has a list of common problems and possible
solutions. Do you see your problem listed?</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <th width="40%">Problem</th>

    <tr>
        <td width="40%">org.w3c.dom.Node: method getNamespaceURI()Ljava/lang/String;
        not found</td>
        <td width="60%">Classpath is not set correctly: you still
        have some old parser or some other JAR file that has the
        org.w3c.dom.* classes <em>ahead</em> of a non-namespace
        aware parser. Please follow the installation instructions
        carefully again and verify you did everything right. If
        you start the server on a command line, type &quot;<strong>javap
        org.w3c.dom.Node</strong>&quot; and see whether you see<blockquote>
            <p><em>public abstract java.lang.String
            getNamespaceURI();</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>in the output. If not, you still have a problem. Even
        if you do, you still have to make sure that your server
        configuration does not introduce some other parser ahead
        of the user classpath at startup time. (The default setup
        in Tomcat does this, for example.)</p>
