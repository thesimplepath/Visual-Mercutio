<h2 align="center">Tools</h2>
<P>As we all know, there are times when things
never seem to work correctly. While we can't
eliminate all problems, we can help you to
determine their cause; at least for problems
with Apache SOAP.</P>
<P>In order to debug problems with Apache SOAP,
it's often useful to see the SOAP messages
which are travelling back and forth between
the client and the server. To make that task
a little easier, we have included a TCP tunnel/monitor
tool to help debug SOAP (as well as other
TCP-based protocols.) The GUI-based tool
will open a port on the machine upon which
it was started, and will tunnel traffic to
a remote host/port combination. Inside the
tool's GUI, you will see two windows which
show data originating from the client and
from the server. </P>
<P>To start the tool up, execute:</P>
<PRE>java org.apache.soap.util.net.TcpTunnelGui <B><I>listenport</I></B> <B><I>tunnelhost</I></B> <B><I>tunnelport</I></B></PRE>
<P>where <B><I>listenport</I></B> is the port that you want the tool to listen
on (i.e. the port which you will send your
SOAP messages to), <B><I>tunnelhost</I></B> is the hostname of the SOAP server, and
<B><I>tunnelport</I></B> is the port that the SOAP server is running
on.</P>
