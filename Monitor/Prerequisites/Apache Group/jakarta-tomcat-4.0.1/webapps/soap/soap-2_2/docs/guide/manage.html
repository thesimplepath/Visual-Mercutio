<h2 align="center">Managing Services</h2>

<p>Apache-SOAP provides an administration tool
to manage services.
There are two clients to service manager:
an HTML one used via a
browser and a command-line tool. </p>

<p><I>NOTE: If you had previously deployed services
to an older version of Apache-SOAP,
then this version may not recognize those
services because the class that was being
serialized to represent services has changed
since then.</I></p>

<h3>Running the Server Side Admin Tool to Manage Services</h3>

<p>With the Apache-SOAP Administration Tools it is possible to
use a Web browser to deploy and un-deploy services and to review
the list and the definitions of the services deployed on a given
SOAP server. </p>

<p>Point your browse to <a href="http://hostname:port/soap">http://hostname:port/soap/admin</a>
(see above) and you will get the &quot;Apache-SOAP Admin&quot;
screen with three options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Deploy </b>to deploy a new service. </li>
    <li><b>Un-deploy </b>to remove a deployed service. </li>
    <li><b>List </b>shows the list of services currently deployed
        in the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The usage of these functions is immediate once one understands
the nature of the information required for deploying a service.
In the next section we describe this information.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Service Deployment Information</b></p>

<p>We review here the information that defines a deployed service.
This information must be provided when using the Deploy function,
and can be browsed using the List function. We refer to this
information as &quot;properties&quot; of the service. </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>ID.</b> An URN uniquely identifies the service to
        clients. It must be unique among the deployed services,
        and be encoded as a URI. We commonly use the format: urn:UniqueServiceID
        . It corresponds to the target object ID, in the
        terminology of the SOAP specification. </li>
    <li><b>Scope. </b>Defines the lifetime of the object serving
        the invocation request. This corresponds scope attribute
        of the &lt;jsp:useBean&gt; tag in the JavaServer Pages.
        It may thus have the following possible values: <ul>
            <li><b>page:</b> the object is available until the
                target JSP page (in this case the rpcrouter.jsp)
                sends a response back or the request is forwarded
                to another page (if you are using the standard
                deployment mechanism this is unlikely to happen).
            </li>
            <li><b>request: </b>the object is available for the
                complete duration of the request, regardless of
                forwarding. </li>
            <li><b>session: </b>the object is available for the
                complete duration of the session. </li>
            <li><b>application: </b>any page within the
                application may access the object. In particular,
                successive service invocations belonging to
                different sessions will share the same instance
                of the object. It is important to observe that
                the value of this attribute can have important
                security implications. The page and request
                scopes assure the isolation of successive calls.
                On the other extreme, application scope implies
                that all service objects are shared among
                different users of the SOAP server. A document
                describing usage scenarios for different scopes
                will be forthcoming. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Method list. </b>Defines the names of the method that
        can be invoked on this service object.</li>
    <li><b>Provider type.</b><strong> </strong>Indicates whether the service is implemented
  using Java, a scripting language, or a user-defined
  provider. If you are using a user-defined
  provider, then you also need to specify the
  fully qualified class name of the provider,
  as well as any options (key/value pairs)
  that you wish to pass to it.</li>
    <li><b>For Java services, Provider class.</b> Fully specified
        class name of the target object servicing the request. </li>
    <li><b>For Java services, Use static class. </b>If set to<b> </b>&quot;Yes&quot;
        the class method that is made available is a static
        method, and thus no object will be instantiated. When
        static invocation is used, the &quot;scope&quot; property
        is not applicable. </li>
    <li><strong>For script services, Script language.</strong>
        Indicates the scripting language used to implement the
        service.</li>
    <li><strong>For script services, Script filename.</strong>
        Name of file containing the script, or</li>
    <li><strong>For script services, Script.</strong> The actual
        script to run.</li>
    <li><b>Type mappings. </b>In order to control the
        serialization and deserialization of specific Java types
        to and from XML in a particular encoding style, it may be
        necessary to provide serialization and deserialization
        classes that know how to perform the correct conversions
        for those types. The Apache-SOAP server already includes
        serialization classes for most basic types in the SOAP
        encoding style, as well as a Bean encoding class that can
        provide a generic serialization of a bean in terms of its
        properties. It also includes XMI serializer/deserializer
        classes to support the XMI encoding style. Since
        different types may require additional support for
        correct serialization, the Apache-SOAP maintains a
        registry of Serializers and Deserializers. The registry
        is accessible to service administrators through the
        Apache-SOAP administration tool, as well as through a
        program API. In order to register a (de)serializer class,
        the class must implement the Serializer or Deserializer
        interfaces, see JavaDocs for org.apache.soap.util.xml.Serializer
        and com.org.apache.soap.util.Deserializer .</li>
    
    <li><b>Default Mapping Registry.</b> Fully-qualified classname of a customized registry that will manage the serializer/deserializers for the service.  Must be a subclass of org.apache.soap.encoding.SOAPMappingRegistry. In the XML deployment descriptor, this can be specified in a "defaultRegistryClass" attribute of the "isd:mappings" element</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the Command Line Tool to Manage Services</h3>

<p>The command line tool is run by typing java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient.
Running this yields:</p>
<PRE>% java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient
Usage: java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient [-auth username:password] url operation arguments
where
        username and password is the HTTP Basic authentication info
        url is the Apache SOAP router's URL whose services are managed
        operation and arguments are:
                deploy deployment-descriptor-file.xml
                list
                query service-name
                undeploy service-name
</PRE>
<p>To deploy a service, for example, type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>% java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient <a
href="http://hostname:port/soap/servlet/rpcrouter">http://hostname:port/soap/servlet/rpcrouter</a> <strong>deploy</strong> foo.xml</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where foo.xml is the deployment descriptor and the URL is
appropriate for your installation.</p>
