<h2 align="center">Installation Instructions for Apache SOAP v2.2</h2>

<p>The Apache-SOAP distribution can be installed for use as a
client or as a server. This document provides installation
instructions for both cases and also has a trouble shooting
section to help sort out common installation related problems.</p>

<p><strong>Important note for users upgrading from older versions
of Apache SOAP: </strong>If you are upgrading from an older
version of Apache SOAP then you must be sure to remove any cached
class files, DeployedServices.ds files etc. or you will get a
variety of strange errors. If you deployed Apache SOAP using a
Web app, then any old expanded WARs must also be removed.
Services deployed into the old version cannot be automatically
transferred to the new version - you must manually re-deploy them
to the new version. That is, the old DeployedServices.ds file
cannot be read by this new version. We apologize in advanced for
the pain this will cause some of our users. If you are in fact
upgrading from an older version of Apache SOAP and get any funny,
unusual looking exceptions or behavior, then most likely the
problem is some unexpected interaction with code from the older
version. Please clean up and try again or try installing in a
virgin environment.</p>

<h3>Unpack the Distribution</h3>

<p>We assume that you have downloaded the binary distribution of
Apache-SOAP and have extracted the archive into the directory <tt>/foo</tt>.
Thus the files from the distribution are in the directory <tt>/foo/soap-2_2/</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that if you are on a Win32 machine then you should
replace &quot;/&quot; with &quot;\&quot; as you follow these
instructions.</p>

<h3>Client-Side Instructions</h3>

<p>Your classpath must contain <strong>/foo/soap-2_2/soap.jar</strong>
and the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>mail.jar</strong> from <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">JavaMail</a></li>
    <li><strong>activation.jar </strong>from <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/beans/glasgow/jaf.html">JavaBeans
        Activation Framework</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/xml_jaxp.html"
        target="_top">JAXP</a> compatible, namespace-aware XML
        parser such as <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j">Apache
        Xerces</a> (v1.1.2 or later). If you have other non-namespace
        aware XML parsers on your classpath then the namespace-aware
        parser must be at the front of your classpath. Apache
        SOAP will not work otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, to run the samples that came with the
distribution, add <strong>/foo/soap-2_2</strong> to your
classpath.</p>

<h3>Server-Side Instructions</h3>

<p>You need to ensure that the server classpath contains all of
the above components. In addition, to implement services in
scripting languages (such as the calculator sample), add <strong>bsf.jar</strong>
from <a
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">BSF</a>
and <strong>js.jar</strong> from <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> to your classpath.</p>

<p>To install the server-side of Apache-SOAP, you need a Web
application server that supports servlets and JSPs (if you want
to run the admin client as well). </p>

<p><strong>Installing the router servlets and admin client:</strong>
The instructions for how to install varies from one app server to
another. Here are instructions for the following servers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="tomcat.html">Apache Tomcat v3.2</a></li>
    <li><a href="weblogic51.html">BEA WebLogic Application Server
        v5.1</a></li>
    <li><a href="weblogic60.html">BEA WebLogic Application Server
        v6.0</a></li>
    <li><a href="websphere.html">IBM WebSphere v3.5</a></li>
    <li><a href="iPlanet.html">iPlanet Application Server 6.0</a></li>
    <li><a href="JRun.html">JRun 3.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Didn't find yours listed? See whether the instructions for
Tomcat (for example) gives you enough hints on how to do it. If
not, first check the FAQ (<a
href="http://xml.apache.org/soap/faq" target="_top">http://xml.apache.org/soap/faq</a>)
and if that fails try asking on the Apache-SOAP user's list; more
than likely someone else has done it already. You can subscribe
to the list here: <a href="http://xml.apache.org/soap/mail.html"
target="_top">http://xml.apache.org/soap/mail.html</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="test-install">Testing Your Server-Side Installation</a></h3>

<p>Point your browser to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>http://localhost:port/soap/servlet/rpcrouter</code> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>http://localhost:port/soap/servlet/messagerouter</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>where <code>port</code> is <code>8080</code>, or <code>4040</code>,
or whatever port your particular HTTP server is listening on. The
browser should display the following:</p>

<blockquote>
    <h4>SOAP (RPC|Message) Router</h4>
    <p><code>Sorry, I don't speak via HTTP GET- you have to use
    HTTP POST to talk to me. </code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't see this message, your server is not configured
correctly. If you do, you now know your router URLs: they are the
URLs you pointed your browser to.</p>

<p>To test whether you have proper server and client-side stuff
set up, follow the client-side instructions to put the right
things on your classpath and type the following:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>java org.apache.soap.server.ServiceManagerClient </code><code><em>rpc-router-url</em></code><code>
    list</code> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>where the first argument above is the RPC router URL you
determined earlier (the one with &quot;rpcrouter&quot; at the end).
[NOTE: The above command line is one long line; your browser may
show it on two lines but do NOT put it on two lines!]</p>

<p>If this succeeds you will see it return with no output or with
a list of URIs. Either case is successful - it indicates what
services are already deployed on your server. If you get anything
else then its time to <a href="../trouble/index.html">troubleshoot</a>.
</p>

<h3>SSL Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Getting SSL support up and running:</strong> The
instructions for how to get SSL support running vary from server
to server: Here are instructions for the following servers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="FAQ_Tomcat_SOAP_SSL.html">Apache Tomcat v3.2</a></li>
</ul>
