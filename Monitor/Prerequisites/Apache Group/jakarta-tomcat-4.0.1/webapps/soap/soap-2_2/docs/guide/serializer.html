<H2 align="center">Creating Type Mappings</H2>
<P>Apache SOAP uses type mappings to determine
how Java datatypes should be marshalled to/unmarshalled
from XML so that they can be transmitted
on/received from the wire. The type mappings
are stored in a type mapping registry, with
the default registry being org.apache.soap.encoding.SOAPMappingRegistry.<BR>
<BR>
Each type mapping carries several pieces
of information: a URI describing the encoding
style (i.e. http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/,)
a qualified name (QName) for the XML element
(i.e. http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema:int,)
the Java class to be encoded from/decoded
to, the name of the Java class to act as
the serializer, and the name of the Java
class to act as the deserializer. The Java
classes acting as serializers/deserializers
must implement org.apache.soap.util.xml.Serializer
and org.apache.soap.util.xml.Deserializer,
respectively.</P>
<P>To make life a little easier, a set of type
mappings has been predefined and registered
into the SOAPMappingRegistry for the SOAP
encoding style. These include mappings for
the following Java types:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>all Java primitive types, such as int, float,
  boolean, byte, etc. and their corresponding
  wrapper classes (i.e. java.lang.Integer,
  java.lang.Boolean, etc.)
  <LI>Java arrays
  <LI>java.lang.String
  <LI>java.util.Date
  <LI>java.util.GregorianCalendar
  <LI>java.util.Vector
  <LI>java.util.Hashtable
  <LI>java.util.Map (under Java editions in which
  this is supported)
  <LI>java.math.BigDecimal
  <LI>javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart
  <LI>java.io.InputStream
  <LI>javax.activation.DataSource
  <LI>javax.activation.DataHandler
  <LI>org.apache.soap.util.xml.QName
  <LI>org.apache.soap.rpc.Parameter
  <LI>java.lang.Object (a deserializer for null
  objects only)
</UL>
<P>The SOAPMappingRegistry also provides a type
mapping to encode org.apache.soap.rpc.Parameters
in the literal XML encoding style, and a
set of mappings to encode types supported
by the <A href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmiframework">IBM XMI Framework</A> in the XMI encoding style.</P>
<P>If you want to pass your own objects as parameters
to SOAP RPC services, then you will need
to register new type mappings (and possibly
create your own serializers/deserializers.)
<I>Remember that you will need to register the
new type mappings on both the server and
the client sides.</I></P>
<H3>Registering Type Mappings on the Server</H3>
<P>There are two main ways to register type
mapping information into an Apache SOAP server:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Registering them via the deployment descriptor.
  <LI>Overriding the default mapping registry with
  a registry that has your new type mappings
  pre-registered.
  </OL>
<P>The first way is probably the easiest to
implement and manage, but it does require
that you replicate the mapping information
in each deployment descriptor that needs
it. For more information on registering type
mapping information via a deployment descriptor,
look <A href="deploy.html#typemapping">here</A>.</P>
<P>The second mechanism requires a little more
work, but allows you to limit the amount
of additional information that you need to
put into each deployment descriptor. In addition,
the same mapping registry may be used on
the client side, and thus may cut down on
the amount of additional code that must be
written for the client. The new registry
must be a subclass of the SOAPMappingRegistry.
For information about overriding the default
mapping registry, look <A href="deploy.html#typemapping">here</A>.</P>
<H3>Registering Type Mappings on the Client</H3>
<P>As is the case with the server, on the client
there are also two main ways to register
type mapping information:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Create an instance of the SOAPMappingRegistry
  and use the mapTypes(...) method to add
  new
  mappings.
  <LI>Create an instance of a subclass of the SOAPMappingRegistry
  that already has your mappings pre-registered.
</OL>
<P>The first way is probably the easiest to
do, but if you have to use the same type
mappings in multiple different clients or
if you are also implementing the server-side
as well, then the second method may save
you a little bit of coding.</P>
<H3>The Bean Serializer/Deserializer</H3>
<P>In many cases, even if there is not a default
type mapping for the object that you are
trying to transmit, you still may not need
to create a new serializer/deserializer.
Apache SOAP comes with a Java Bean Serializer/Deserializer
that may suit your needs. The org.apache.soap.encoding.soapenc.BeanSerializer
can be used to serialize and deserialize
JavaBeans using the SOAP encoding style.
The public properties of the bean will become
named accessors (elements) in the XML form.
To use the BeanSerializer, simply pass &quot;org.apache.soap.encoding.soapenc.BeanSerializer&quot;
as the last two parameters when you are registering
the type mapping for your object.<BR>
<I><BR>
Note: The object that you are serializing
with the BeanSerializer <B>MUST</B> be a <A href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/index.html">JavaBean</A> for this serializer to work:</I></P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>It <B>MUST</B> have a no-args constructor</I>
  <LI><I>It <B>MUST</B> expose all interesting state through properties</I>
  <LI><I>It <B>MUST</B> not matter what order the accessors for
  the properties (i.e. the setX/getX methods)
  are in</I>
  <LI><I>etc.</I>
</UL>
<P><I> This is <B>NOT</B> a general/all-purpose serializer. It <B>WILL NOT</B> work if the object which you are serializing/deserializing
does not conform to the <A href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/docs/spec.html">JavaBeans definition</A>. It is <B>NOT</B> a bug if you cannot serialize/deserialize
your non-Bean, Java class with this, any
more than it is a bug that you can't serialize
a java.awt.Panel with the java.util.Date
serializer.</I> </P>
<H3>Creating New Serializers and Deserializers</H3>
<P>If you need to create a new serializer/deserializer,
then looking at the source code for the predefined
ones will probably provide you with the best
guidance. Remember that they will need to
implement org.apache.soap.util.xml.Serializer
and org.apache.soap.util.xml.Deserializer
respectively. You can implement them both
in the same class, or use two different classes,
it really makes no difference.</P>
