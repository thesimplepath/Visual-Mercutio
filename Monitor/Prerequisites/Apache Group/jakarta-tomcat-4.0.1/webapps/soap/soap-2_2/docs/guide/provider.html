<h2 align="center">Writing Providers</h2>
<P>When creating services, it makes sense to
take advantage of legacy programming artifacts
in order to not have to reinvent the wheel,
and to program in the language(s) in which
you are most comfortable. The developers
of Apache SOAP recognized that not all services
were going to be methods on Java classes,
and architected a way to allow any type of
programming artifact to be used as a service
implementation. To enable this, a layer of
abstraction was created between the Apache
SOAP server and the service implementation.
This layer is called the Apache SOAP Pluggable
Provider.</P>
<P>A pluggable provider acts as the bridge between
the SOAP engine and the service which is
being invoked. The provider is responsible
for:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>locating the service implementation
  <LI>loading the service implementation
  <LI>invoking the service
  <LI>converting the result from the service implementation
  into a SOAP envelope when necessary
</UL>
<P>Apache SOAP comes with six predefined providers:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.RPCJavaProvider<BR>
  This provider is the default for exposing
  Java artifacts and BSF-supported scripts
  via SOAP RPC. 
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.MsgJavaProvider<BR>
  This provider is the default for exposing
  Java artifacts and BSF-supported scripts
  via SOAP Messages.
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.StatelessEJBProvider<BR>
  This provider allows you to expose Stateless
  Session Beans as services.
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.StatefulEJBProvider<BR>
  This provider allows you to expose Stateful
  Session Beans as services.
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.EntityEJBProvider<BR>
  This provider allows you to expose Entity
  Beans as services.
  <LI>org.apache.soap.providers.com.RPCProvider<BR>
  This provider allows you to expose COM objects
  via SOAP RPC. <I>Note: This provider works only under Windows.</I> For more information about the COM provider,
  look <A href="../../samples/com/readme.htm">here</A>.
</UL>
<H3>Using Pluggable Providers</H3>
<P>Information about the provider that you wish
your service to use is located in the deployment
descriptor. The &lt;provider&gt; element,
as well as its descendent elements, provide
information to the runtime and provider about
what they should do to make a service accessible.
The <I>type</I> attribute on the &lt;provider&gt; element
identifies the Java class which should act
as the provider. If you are exposing a Java
class (either as an RPC-based service or
as a message-oriented service) then you should
specify &quot;java&quot; as the value for
this attribute, if you are exposing a BSF-supported
script then you should specify &quot;script&quot;,
otherwise you should specify the fully qualified
classname of the provider.</P>
<P>Additional information to the pluggable providers
may be specified by adding &lt;option&gt;
elements as descendents to the &lt;provider&gt;
elements. For more information about specifying
pluggable providers and their options, look
<A href="deploy.html">here</A>.</P>
<H3>Writing Pluggable Providers</H3>
<P>If you need to support programming artifacts
which are not directly supported by one of
the included providers, or if one of the
included providers does not quite meet your
needs, then you will need to create your
own pluggable provider.</P>
<P>Providers need to implement the org.apache.soap.util.Provider
interface, which is as follows:</P>

<pre>public interface Provider {
  public void locate( DeploymentDescriptor dd,
                      Envelope             env,
                      Call                 call,
                      String               methodName,
                      String               targetObjectURI,
                      SOAPContext          reqContext)
                throws SOAPException ;
  public void invoke(SOAPContext req, SOAPContext res) throws SOAPException ;
}
</pre>
    The <code>locate</code> method will be called in order to allow
the provider a chance to verify that the
service implementation exists and is available
to process the request. If an error occurs,
this method should throw a SOAPException.
After a successful call to <code>locate</code> the SOAP engine will then execute the <code>invoke</code> method to actually call the service implementation.
Notice that the <code>invoke</code> call does not have any information about
the service. All of that information was
passed into the <code>locate</code> method, so it is the responsibility of <code>locate</code> to save whatever information is needed so that
    <code>invoke</code> can call the service.
<p> The <code>invoke</code> method is also responsible for converting
any response from the service implementation
into a SOAP envelope and placing it in the
<b>res</b> parameter (a SOAPContext).



<P>If any &lt;option&gt; elements which were
specified in the deployment descriptor for
the service are accessible as properties
via a Hashtable retrieved through a call
to <B>dd</B>.getProps() in the <CODE>locate</CODE> method.</P>
