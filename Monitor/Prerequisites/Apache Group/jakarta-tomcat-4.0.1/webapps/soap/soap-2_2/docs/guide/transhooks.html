<H2 align="center">Using Transport Hooks</H2>
<P>Some extensions to the Apache SOAP framework
necessitate the ability to interact with
the SOAP envelope just after it comes off
of the wire, or just before a response goes
out. To facilitate this type of interaction,
Apache SOAP provide the ability to insert
pluggable transport extensions into the runtime.
The current instantiation of these transport
extensions in the Apache SOAP framework are
known as Envelope Editors.</P>
<H3>Using Envelope Editors on the Server</H3>
<P>To enable the enveope editor transport extensions
on the server, you need to set an init-parameter
called <I>EnvelopeEditorFactory</I> in the configuration files for the RPCRouter
and MessageRouter servlets. The value of
this parameter should be the fully qualified
classname of a Java class which implements
org.apache.soap.transport.EnvelopeEditorFactory.</P>
<H3>Using Envelope Editors on the Client</H3>
<P>To use your envelope editor on the client
side you need to instantiate an instance
of your Envelope Editor, and then create
an instance of org.apache.soap.transport.FilterTransport
passing it the Envelope Editor object, and
an instance of the object which represents
whatever transport you are communicating
over (i.e. org.apache.soap.transport.http.SOAPHTTPConnection).
You then need to invoke org.apache.soap.rpc.Call.setSOAPTransport(...)
or org.apache.soap.messaging.Message.setSOAPTransport(...),
depending upon whether you are invoking an
RPC-based service or a message-oriented service,
respectively, passing it your FilterTransport
instance.</P>
<H3>Creating an Envelope Editor</H3>
<P>To create an Envelope Editor, you must first
create an Envelope Editor Factory by implementing
the org.apache.soap.transport.EnvelopeEditorFactory
interface:</P>
<PRE>public interface EnvelopeEditorFactory
{<BR>  public EnvelopeEditor create(Properties props) throws SOAPException;<BR>}</PRE>
<P>The create method takes in a java.util.Properties
object which contains properties which, in
the case of the HTTP servlets, were passed
in from the servlet init-parameters.</P>
<P>To create an Envelope Editor, you need to
implement the org.apache.soap.transport.EnvelopeEditor
interface:</P>
<PRE>public interface EnvelopeEditor
{<BR>  public void editIncoming(Reader in, Writer out) throws SOAPException;<BR>  public void editOutgoing(Reader in, Writer out) throws SOAPException;<BR>}</PRE>
<P>The two methods are the routines which are
called when an incoming message is received
and when an outgoing message is ready to
be sent, respectively.</P>
<P>The class org.apache.soap.transport.EnvelopeEditorAdapter
contains a sample Envelope Editor.</P>
