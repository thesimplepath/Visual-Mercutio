<h1 align="center">Apache-SOAP Version 2.2: Installing the Server Side
Under Apache Tomcat v3.2</h1>

<h2>Getting Tomcat ready:</h2>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Tomcat comes with an XML parser (lib/xml.jar)
which has the DOM level 1 interfaces. Even if you put Xerces 1.1.2's
xerces.jar in your classpath, the wrong interfaces are found by
any Java code running in Tomcat because the shell script / batch
file that runs Tomcat puts the user's classpath at the end. So,
you must edit tomcat.sh or tomcat.bat in the bin/ directory and
put xerces.jar at the BEGINNING of the classpath the script
builds. </p>

<p>If you run startup.bat, then line 105 (or there abouts) of <b>tomcat.bat</b>
should look like this (line 69 for Tomcat 3.2.1) :</p>

<blockquote>
    <code>set CP=path-to-xerces\xerces.jar;%CLASSPATH%;%CP%</code>
</blockquote>

<p>If you run startup.sh, add the following line to  <b>tomcat.sh</b> after
line 113 (or there abouts), so long as it's before the export line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <code>CLASSPATH=path-to-xerces/xerces.jar:${CLASSPATH}</code>
</blockquote>

<h2>Deploying Apache-SOAP on Tomcat:</h2>

<p>There are two different ways to actually deploy Apache SOAP on Tomcat:</p>

<h3>Method 1: Deploying the web archive.</h3>

<p>The Apache SOAP distribution includes a web archive at <code>/soap-2_2/webapps/soap.war</code>.
Simply drop this web archive into Tomcat's webapps directory (i.e. <code>%tomcat_home%/webapps</code>).
If you deploy Apache SOAP into Tomcat in this manner, you will not need to have anything from the
<code>/soap-2_2</code> directory on your server's classpath (the relevant items are included in the web
archive). Note: If you copy the web archive into the webapps directory while Tomcat is running, Tomcat
will need to be restarted before the Apache SOAP web application can be accessed.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you want to replace the deployed Apache SOAP web application with a
later version that you will probably have to shut the server down, remove the expanded
<code>%tomcat_home%/webapps/soap</code> directory, and replace the
<code>%tomcat_home%/webapps/soap.war</code> file with the newer one.</p>

<h3>Method 2: Creating a new &lt;Context&gt; in Tomcat's server.xml file.</h3>

<p>Simply add a new <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code> element into
<code>%tomcat_home%/conf/server.xml</code>:</p>

<code>&lt;Context path=&quot;/soap&quot; docBase=&quot;path-to-apache-soap/webapps/soap&quot;
         debug=&quot;1&quot; reloadable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;</code>

<p>Now, make sure you have the jar files from the lib directory
of this distribution on your classpath and start up tomcat. Also,
you will want to have on the classpath any of your code that you
want to deploy as services (e.g. <code>/soap-2_2</code> if you want to deploy
any of the included samples).</p>

<h2>Accessing the Apache SOAP context:</h2>

<p>You should be able to deploy services by pointing a browser to</p>

<blockquote>
    <code><a href="http://hostname:port/soap">http://hostname:port/soap</a></code>
</blockquote>

<p>where hostname is the host on which Tomcat is running and port
is the port. See the User's Guide for details on the
administration tool. The SOAP end-point for invoking services on
this server is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <code><a href="http://hostname:port/soap/servlet/rpcrouter">http://hostname:port/soap/servlet/rpcrouter</a></code>
</blockquote>

<p>Happy SOAP-ing!</p>
