<H2 align="center">Writing Message Clients</H2>
<P>Writing clients to access SOAP message-oriented
services requires that you interact with
a lower-level set of Apache SOAP APIs than
you would otherwise have to if you were writing
a SOAP RPC-based client. However, message-oriented
services provide you with a finer grain of
control over what is actually being transmitted
over SOAP. (In fact, the RPC mechanism is
built on type of this message-oriented layer.)</P>
<P>The basic steps for creating a client which
interacts with a SOAP message-oriented service
are as follows:</P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Obtain the interface description of the SOAP
  service, so that you know what the format
  of the SOAP message should be (i.e. what
  headers it should have, what the body should
  look like, etc.) as well as the type of
  message
  exchange which will take place.</B><BR>
  You can either look at a WSDL file (or
  at
  some other interface definition format)
  for
  the service, or directly at its implementation.
  Unlike SOAP RPC, there is no predefined
  message
  exchange pattern defined, so a message-oriented
  service may return a SOAP envelope, may
  return
  another type of data, or may return nothing
  at all.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI><B>Construct an org.apache.soap.Envelope which
  contains the information that the SOAP
  service
  requires.</B><BR>
  At the very least, you will need to add
  an
  org.apache.soap.Body object to the envelope.
  You can optionally add headers as well.<BR>
  <I>
  Note: When the message is received on the
  server, it will be routed to the proper
  service
  by looking at the XML Namespace associated
  with the first child element in the body,
  and then to the correct method/function
  within
  that service via the name of the element
  itself.</I><BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI><B>Create an org.apache.soap.messaging.Message
  object.</B><BR>
  If you need to <A href="attachments.html">add MIME attachments</A> to your message, then you can use addBodyPart(...)
  method to do so. If you need to send your
  message over a transport other than HTTP,
  then you will need to invoke the setSOAPTransport(...)
  method.<BR>
  <BR>
  <LI><B>Invoke the send(...) method on the Message
  object, providing the URL of the endpoint
  which is providing the service (i.e. http://localhost/soap/servlet/messagerouter),
  the actionURI, and your envelope.</B><BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI><B>If your service is returning data, and assuming
  that the transport supports two-way interaction,
  then you need to retrieve the SOAPTransport
  object from the Message object (assuming
  that you don't already have a handle to it)
  by using the getSOAPTransport() method. You
  can then invoke the receive() method on the
  SOAPTransport object to retrieve the returned
  data.</B><BR>
  If the service is returning a SOAP Envelope,
  then you can parse the XML and pass the root
  element to org.apache.soap.Envelope's unmarshall(..)
  method to allow it to reconstruct a SOAP
  Envelope object for you. If an error has
  occurred on the server during the processing
  of the request, the server will automatically
  send back a SOAP Envelope with a SOAP Fault
  in the body describing what went wrong.
