<H2 align="center">Writing RPC Services</H2>
<P>Writing an RPC-based SOAP service is a very
trivial undertaking, and really only involves
the following two basic steps:<BR>
</P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Create a code artifact which is supported
  by one of the Apache SOAP providers</B>; either a standard Java class (including
  Java Beans,) an EJB, or a BSF supported script.
  The code artifact does not have to know anything
  about Apache SOAP, as you will simply be
  exposing either a method or a script function
  that exists within the artifact. For example,
  if you create a Java class that has a method
  called add(), then you could expose that
  method as a SOAP service. Multiple methods
  may be exposed for a single service, as is
  described in the next section.<BR>
  <I>Note that parameters to your method/function
  must be serializable by SOAP, and so must
  exist within the SOAP mapping registry.</I><I> For information on creating type mappings,
  look <A href="serializer.html">here</A>.</I><BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI><B>Create an Apache SOAP deployment descriptor
  for your service.</B> The deployment descriptor provides the implementation
  with the information necessary to handle
  requests for an offered service. For a Java
  service implementation, this will include
  such information as the name of the class
  which is providing the implementation, as
  well as the name of the methods which are
  to be exposed. More information about the
  deployment descriptors may be found <A href="deploy.html">here</A>.<BR>
  
</OL>
<P>In a Java based service implementation, you
may throw a SOAPException to indicate that
some error has occurred when processing the
request. Throwing a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_CLIENT,
...) will allow your service implementation
to indicate that the failure was due to a
client error, whereas throwing a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_SERVER,
...) will indicate that your service implementation
was at fault. (If you throw any other type
of exception, the server will catch it, and
will pass it on as a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_SERVER,
...)) See the SOAP v1.1 specification for
more information on SOAP Faults.</P>
