<H2 align="center">Writing Message Services</H2>
<P>Creating message-oriented services in Apache
SOAP is a little more complex than creating
a simple RPC-based service, but in many cases
a message-oriented model provides a better
fit to the problem which you are trying to
solve. In a message-oriented service, the
service implementation is responsible for
processing the contents of the SOAP Envelope.
That is to say, that while the Apache SOAP
API's are still available to interact with
the SOAPEnvelope object, the service implementation
must invoke those calls which are necessary
to extract whatever information from the
header and body that are needed for it to
process the request. If the message-oriented
service is participating in in a request-response
protocol which uses SOAP messages in both
directions, then it is also responsible for
generating the appropriate response SOAPEnvelope.
(A message-oriented service does not have
to return a SOAPEnvelope, but instead can
return anything that it wants.)</P>
<P>Because message-oriented services have full
control over the SOAP Envelopes, any XML
document may be passed as part of the envelope
body. When the service receives the SOAP
Envelope, it is free to extract the body,
and do with it as it pleases.</P>
<P>Unlike RPC-service implementations, message-oriented
service implementations must all conform
to a single interface:</P>
<PRE>void <B><I>name</I></B>(SOAPEnvelope <B><I>request-envelope</I></B>, SOAPContext <B><I>request-context</I></B>, SOAPContext <B><I>response-context</I></B>)</PRE>
<P>where <B><I>name</I></B> is the name of the method/function, <B><I>request-envelope</I></B> is the SOAPEnvelope containing the incoming
message, <B><I>request-context</I></B> is the SOAPContext for the incoming message,
and <B><I>response-context</I></B> is the SOAPContext which may be used for
a response if one is needed.</P>
<P>If the communications transport which you
are using supports two-way interaction, such
as HTTP, then you can use the response context
to send a response back to the client. If
you want to send a SOAP Envelope back to
the client, you can use the org.apache.soap.Envelope's
marshall(...) method to marshall your envelope
to a java.io.StringWriter, and then invoke
the response context's setRootPart(...) method,
passing the StringWriter as the first argument.
If you want to send back any other data types,
then you may need to invoke other methods
in the response context.</P>
<P>As with RPC-based service implementations,
in a Java based message-oriented service
implementation you may throw a SOAPException
to indicate that some error has occurred
when processing the request. Throwing a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_CLIENT,
...) will allow your service implementation
to indicate that the failure was due to a
client error, whereas throwing a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_SERVER,
...) will indicate that your service implementation
was at fault. (If you throw any other type
of exception, the server will catch it, and
will pass it on as a SOAPException(FAULT_CODE_SERVER,
...)) If your transport supports two-way
interaction, such as HTTP, then a SOAP Envelope
containing a SOAP Fault will automatically
be returned to the client. See the SOAP v1.1
specification for more information on SOAP
Faults.</P>
