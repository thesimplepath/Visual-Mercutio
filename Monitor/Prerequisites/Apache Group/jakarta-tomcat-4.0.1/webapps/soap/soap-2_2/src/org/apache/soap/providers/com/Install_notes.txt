Subject: COM Pluggable provider

1. The zip you sent me contains all of the necessary files including the
modified Build.xml needed to conditionally compile the COM provider?
Yes.  Though it now may need to be merged now.

2. There are full instructions on how to build and use the COM Provider?
I didn't provide specific build instructions.  Having said that its very
simple:
   Set up like your would to build the rest of SOAP.
   Issues vcvars32.bat. Provided by MS as part of MS VS 6.0 (required)
   Append to your "include" envirnonment var. the name of the directory in
   your jdk that contains "jni.h"
   Append to your "lib" environment var. the name of the directory in your
   jdk that contains "jvm.lib"
   Issue ant compile com
If you don't issue the com target it all compiles as before. Nothing in
SOAP depends on this so as long as the BUILD.xml is  merged in ok nothing
else should break.
In samples\com\readme.htm is detailed information about runtime and using.

Very important point:  The build for the sample code is done with a GUI I
always checked in the dlls since I have never did a build from
a command line for VB code,  most people don't, I strongly recommend
checking these in (-kb) because some people may want to run the demo but
not
do a build.  The source is ALL there.  If you have VB installed and double
click on the *.vbp files it will launch VB to edit and buld them.  This is
explained in the docs. Once again doing this will have no affect on any
other part of SOAP.

3. All of the code has been thoroughly tested?
Yes.  But there is always the unexpected.
